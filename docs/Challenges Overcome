**Challenges Overcome**
  - Needing proper usb wifi adapter
      - Purchased 3 adapters before finding the correct one, totalling $130
  - Airgeddon not working with Kali Kernel >= 6.2
      - It would not tell you what was wrong or give any error codes or logs
      - Finally resolved the issue by looking into the Airgeddon discord server where they talked about it
  - Usb drivers for the adapter I used are finicky and do not work all the time
      - No real fix but works some of the time and sometimes not just got to keep trying until it works and finish before it decides to quit
  - Virtualbox guest additions would crash Kali often trying to install them
      - Eventually got them installed after hours of trouble shooting
